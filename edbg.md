## edbg

### Very different paradigm, interactive debugger

```
:edbg.fstart([{:queue,:new}])
```

### Stop

```
:edbg.fstop()
```

### Start interactive session / debugger?

```
:edbg.file()
```

I don't fully grok it so there is probably something here for the right person.

The tool, much like recon, includes more than just the tracing functionality.
